# connect4_internpe
## How to play?
Connect 4 is simple game played on a standing board with 7 rows and 7 columns. TWO pieces of player1 and player2. Each player can drop a piece from top in any one of the columns and the piece will fall and settle on the next empty slot
available on the board. Players take alternative turns until one of the players win or until no more moves are possible. A player wins if she
has four of her pieces placed consecutively horizontally, vertically or diagonally! 
In this game, I have used '1' and '2' players. I have designed it on my own so you can look and change the design accordingly.
